= MuckComments

Add comments to any object.  This gem is the muck version of acts_as_commentable_with_threading (http://github.com/elight/acts_as_commentable_with_threading/tree/master)

== Setup
Install the the awesome_nested_set gem (http://github.com/collectiveidea/awesome_nested_set/tree/master)

  gem sources -a http://gems.github.com
  sudo gem install collectiveidea-awesome_nested_set

Then add it to your environment.rb:

  config.gem "collectiveidea-awesome_nested_set", :lib => 'awesome_nested_set'

== Usage

=== Comment model
Create a model called comment in your project and add the following:
  
  class Comment < ActiveRecord::Base
    acts_as_muck_comment
  end
This let's you add any other methods to the comment model that you see fit.

=== Comment controller
Override the comments controller to change the the security model.  For example:

  class CommentsController < Muck::CommentsController
    
    before_filter :login_required # require the user to be logged in to make a comment
    
    # Modify this method to change how permissions are checked to see if a user can comment.
    # Each model that implements 'acts_as_muck_comment' can override can_comment? to 
    # change how comment permissions are handled.
    def has_permission_to_comment(user, parent)
      parent.can_comment?(user)
    end
    
  end

=== Attach comments to a model:

For a given model add 'acts_as_commentable'
  class Blog < ActiveRecord::Base
    acts_as_commentable
  end

'acts_as_commentable' will automatically track the count, but you will need to add a column to your table called comment_count:

  class AddCommentCache < ActiveRecord::Migration
    def self.up
      add_column :blogs, :comment_count, :integer, :default => 0
    end

    def self.down
      remove_column :blogs, :comment_count
    end
  end

Then you will be able to do this to get a comment count:
  
  @blog.comment_count

=== Configuration
Add the following to globalconfig.yml:
  send_email_for_new_comments: true

This will send out an email to each user that has participated in a comment thread.  The default email is basic and only includes the body
of the comment.  Add new email views to provide a better email for you users.  They can be found in app/views/comment_mailer/new_comment.text.html.erb
and app/views/comment_mailer/new_comment.text.plain.erb

=== Comment partial
When calling create in the comments controller with :format => 'json' the resulting json will include an 'html' field that contains
a rendered version of the comment html.  To facilitate this process be sure to create a partial called '_comment.html.erb' under a directory
with the same name as the parent object.  The partial will be passed an object 'comment_owner' that references the parent object.

For example, for an object 'activity' that acts_as_commentable create a partial 'activities/_comment.html.erb'.  The contents might look like this:

  <div id="<%= comment.dom_id %>">
    <span class="user"><%= link_to comment_owner.user, comment_owner.user %></span>
    <p><%= h comment.body %></p>
  </div>
